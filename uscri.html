           <p> As the web developer intern at USCRI, I was assigned the task of recreating the office intranet site. The site is used for employee-only forms, documents, files, and links to helpful resources. The office uses SharePoint Online 2013 as a part of Office 365 to host their intranet site. Most of my technical learning experience at USCRI was adapting websites to work with SharePoint. Using Master Pages and SharePoint Designer, I developed a solid workflow that suited my HTML/CSS background. Below are some of the many drafts I created over the time I spent at USCRI. All demos below are functioning without SharePoint and their code is not entirely representative of how it would be in SharePoint. The code is also un-minified for easier reading.</p>

        <p>Working under the IT Department, my supervisor and his boss wanted to create a site with full page backgrounds. This initial site was eventually scrapped because of its functional inefficiency. We agreed that employees visit the site to grab a form or document and to help them get there quickly should hold a higher priority than the prominent photography used in this iteration. None the less, it was my first foray into parallax websites and I learned a lot.</p>

        <p>This was one of my favorite iterations. I pitched it after getting the initial concept functional. I had planned a sidebar filled with the home page's main links and a small carousel for announcements. The divided blue background would each have their own photo background to represent the link. This iteration was turned down due to a lack of a full width slideshow for announcements.</p>

        <p>This is the current iteration of the site, inspired by Google's Material design philosophy. Working demo soon!</p>
