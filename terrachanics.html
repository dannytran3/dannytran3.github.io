            Interned as an artist creating the user interface, menu screens and HUD elements for a mobile app called Terrachanics. The game will serve to raise energy awareness to children and teens. The position was a work from home internship with weekly meetings online. I created buttons, logos and 2D animations using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I created the base icons that serves to inform the user of what kind of energy was being used in each building in the game; this resulting in over 77 icons. I created buttons for functions that include undo, wait, pause, enter, save, etc. This job required a high attention to detail, as every pixel on the screen is valuable real estate to convey the right messages to the player on a small touch phone.</p>

        <p>Terrachanics is a puzzle game designed to make users aware of the different forms of energy that powers buildings. Each level of the game starts with a set of buildings, each outputting a type of energy, and requiring an input of a different type. Types of energy include: gas, battery, biodiesel, wind, solar, oil, and nuclear. Included in this input/output system are other attributes that factor into the use of energy: money, commerce, waste, work, and knowledge. Players analyze the buildings and link them all to create a continuous link between all the buildings.</p>

        <p>For this game, I designed the graphical user interface that shows all the commands the player may do. This featured animated wait and undo buttons. There are also graphical elements indicating objectives and helpful tips. I've also created the pause menu.</p>

        <p>My design process relied heavily on iteration. I joined the Terrachanics team after the team had already come up with the design and name of the game. The previous team had left due to various reasons, so I had to pick up where they left off. The art team before me hadn't designed much, so I had a lot of creative freedom. The lead designers of the game also was not sure of what they wanted the look of the game to look like. Most of the time I spent on Terrachanics was on art that did not end up in the game. About 90% of my art was not used, but helped to keep improving the look of our game.</p>

        <p>As it was an internship that was work from home and the team was made up of students, recent graduates and entry-level developers. I was dedicated to finishing the game and continued working with them for another year after I graduated. Every week the art team I was in would meet up online to show art to each other and get feedback to make our art follow a common style. I learned a lot about development cycles, icon design, and making UI look good without detracting from the main art of the game.</p>
